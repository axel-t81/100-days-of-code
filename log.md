# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 24-Feb-25, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Set up a boilerplate Django App on my personal portfolio website, kojreycodes.com

**Thoughts:** It took much longer than planned, but I managed to use SSH to connect with the server from a local terminal in VS Code, as well as work out basic Git commands so I could push the revamped code to GitHub.

### Day 2: 25-Feb-25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Set up a second boilerplate Django App, but this time for a real-world business website for a soon-to-be established social work private practice based in Australia.

**Thoughts:** While I made a couple of similar mistakes as last night (in particular with command line Git and GitHub), overall I'm happy to have had a second attempt at the process completed yesterday. Practice makes progress, yes? I felt much more capable tonight, and I moved through the task much quicker as well. Now I just need to get beyond these boilerplate apps, lol, and start providing viewable content to visitors and users!

### Day 3: 27-Feb-25, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Set up my local environment so I can change my workflow to allow building locally, then pushing to server. As opposed to doing evrything live on a production server. 

**Thoughts:** Very happy! A few more things are beginning to look more familiar and click. I'm also very happy with the support I am getting from GenAI! Not neccessarily just cutting and pasting the AI's code, but instead using AI as a private tutor, or personalised StackOverflow, and then trying to using any AI as a template to read, ideally understand, and then customise.

### Day 4: 28-Feb-25, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Set up the core app within Django of the social work private practice app. Again, like yesterday, have moved the build to my local environment. And thanks to DeepSeek and Claude, I have a good plan moving forwward based on their initial ideas and my personalised feedback. 

**Thoughts:** Parts of me keeps thinking I have to learn more and know more before I start trying to 'cheat' with tools like Claude and DeepSeek, but the other part of me is realising this field of study is never-ending. I could study a lifetime, and still not have 'full knowledge'. Further, as more advanced LLMs are released again and again it's beginning to dawn on me that the way to learn and to build has fundamentally changed. I genuinely think I have learned more about implementing Django applications from reading the plans and code of DeepSeek and Claude and asking them questions about it than I had in a good few months of trying to traditionally learning to be a Django developer. So, I am going to test using LLMs to more rapidly build apps and see how far this way of studying and building can take me (with the caveat that I'm still maintaining my traditional student status in my IT masters for the foreseeable future).

### Day 5: 9-Mar-25, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Have new set of requirements for the social work business app. Worked with DeepSeek and Claude to develop new build plan based on these requirements. Actual progress was getting a new venv sorted out after I couldn't work out how to access the old one. 

**Thoughts:** This was very slow progress tonight. Due to a change in circumstances at home I had to step away from this project and coding for over a week, and some of the lessons and muscle memory had been lost since my last attempt. In reality, tonight's effort was more about finding my feet again and preparing for another push (both with this project, and with the #100daysOfCode).

### Day 6: 10-Mar-25, Monday

**Today's Progress:** With new requirements to just make landing page, have created a skeleton landing page and tested locally, and then uploaded this skeleton site to testing server and domain. Made a few obvious styling and content tweaks (via some HTML and CSS changes within a Django App), but now just waiting on style and content requests from business. 

**Thoughts:** Good progress today. Actually coded in 2x 1-hr blocks today instead of one. Lessons were learned about how Django handles front ends, and while DeepSeek and Claude offered great codes templates, I found it was their 'tutoring' content around this snippets and code templates to be the most valuable. I used to think GenAI was often too verbose in answering questions, but when your a student the added context and detail is invaluable.

### Day 7: 12-Mar-25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Began a rebuild of a dormant project, google-calendar-economic-events, as I haven't yet had the requirements finalised for ssws-privatepractice-website. This app yet isn't yet operating on my local server, but there is the bare bones setup that will allow me to work through a debugging process. So the repo isn't yet functional, but I hope to provide useable updates soon.

**Thoughts:** Made huge leaps in progress today due to stumbling upon Cursor AI while sorting on my email inbox. And while I have used both the Claude and DeepSeek platforms for coding help, Cursor is just at a completely different level. To have all the AI assistance embedded in the IDE, that itself is a mimic of VS Code is an absolute game changer. It's very exciting!

### Day 8: 13-Mar-25, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Added a simple front end to the Google Calendar Economic Events app. This allowed me test the functionality. This testing led to app pivoting from Economic data events to an Earnings release events app. From here, I am now working through page by page to test functionality and optimise the UX. PS: Due to this app pivot, I have also renamed the repo (see below).

**Thoughts:** Still very much enjoying using Cursor as an assistance tool, but have done some digging into what is now known as 'vibe coding' and its accompanying pitfalls. While I'm still very much an advocate for using AI tools like this, I do concede that I need to get my software engineering skills and software development process knowledge both up to a high level. That is, any app built that is assisted heavily using AI will become insecure and unscalable unless I have a very structured process and very good understanding of what's going on under the hood. For now, with these practice apps all is okay, but an awareness of the tools and my own limitations is imperative.

### Day 9: 15-Mar-25, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Not sure if this is allowable in the #100daysOfCode rules, but I'm running with it... Today's work is based on UNE's COSC210 Practical Assignment 1. I am currently writing an SQL script that will create a database for a fictional movie store and streaming service. This script will create a PostgreSQL database and set up the given tables with all the required constraints.

**Thoughts:** Working with SQL and PostgreSQL is still more new to me, and when combined with the fact that I'm a bit behind in my coursework, this small assessment has my rather nervous! I think I should be okay, but the sense of unfamiliarity to another reminder how new I am to this, how much there is to learn, and how the cycle will likely never be finished in this new career
