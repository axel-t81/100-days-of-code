# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 24-Feb-25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Set up a boilerplate Django App on my personal portfolio website, kojreycodes.com

**Thoughts** It took much longer than planned, but I managed to use SSH to connect with the server from a local terminal in VS Code, as well as work out basic Git commands so I could push the revamped code to GitHub.

### Day 2: 25-Feb-25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up a second boilerplate Django App, but this time for a real-world business website for a soon-to-be established social work private practice based in Australia.

**Thoughts** While I made a couple of similar mistakes as last night (in particular with command line Git and GitHub), overall I'm happy to have had a second attempt at the process completed yesterday. Practice makes progress, yes? I felt much more capable tonight, and I moved through the task much quicker as well. Now I just need to get beyond these boilerplate apps, lol, and start providing viewable content to visitors and users!
