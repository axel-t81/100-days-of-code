# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 24-Feb-25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Set up a boilerplate Django App on my personal portfolio website, kojreycodes.com

**Thoughts** It took much longer than planned, but I managed to use SSH to connect with the server from a local terminal in VS Code, as well as work out basic Git commands so I could push the revamped code to GitHub.

### Day 2: 25-Feb-25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up a second boilerplate Django App, but this time for a real-world business website for a soon-to-be established social work private practice based in Australia.

**Thoughts** While I made a couple of similar mistakes as last night (in particular with command line Git and GitHub), overall I'm happy to have had a second attempt at the process completed yesterday. Practice makes progress, yes? I felt much more capable tonight, and I moved through the task much quicker as well. Now I just need to get beyond these boilerplate apps, lol, and start providing viewable content to visitors and users!

### Day 3: 27-Feb-25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Set up my local environment so I can change my workflow to allow building locally, then pushing to server. As opposed to doing evrything live on a production server. 

**Thoughts** Very happy! A few more things are beginning to look more familiar and click. I'm also very happy with the support I am getting from GenAI! Not neccessarily just cutting and pasting the AI's code, but instead using AI as a private tutor, or personalised StackOverflow, and then trying to using any AI as a template to read, ideally understand, and then customise.

### Day 4: 28-Feb-25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Set up the core app within Django of the social work private practice app. Again, like yesterday, have moved the build to my local environment. And thanks to DeepSeek and Claude, I have a good plan moving forwward based on their initial ideas and my personalised feedback. 

**Thoughts** Parts of me keeps thinking I have to learn more and know more before I start trying to 'cheat' with tools like Claude and DeepSeek, but the other part of me is realising this field of study is never-ending. I could study a lifetime, and still not have 'full knowledge'. Further, as more advanced LLMs are released again and again it's beginning to dawn on me that the way to learn and to build has fundamentally changed. I genuinely think I have learned more about implementing Django applications from reading the plans and code of DeepSeek and Claude and asking them questions about it than I had in a good few months of trying to traditionally learning to be a Django developer. So, I am going to test using LLMs to more rapidly build apps and see how far this way of studying and building can take me (with the caveat that I'm still maintaining my traditional student status in my IT masters for the foreseeable future).
