# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 24-Feb-25, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Set up a boilerplate Django App on my personal portfolio website, kojreycodes.com

**Thoughts:** It took much longer than planned, but I managed to use SSH to connect with the server from a local terminal in VS Code, as well as work out basic Git commands so I could push the revamped code to GitHub.

### Day 2: 25-Feb-25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Set up a second boilerplate Django App, but this time for a real-world business website for a soon-to-be established social work private practice based in Australia.

**Thoughts:** While I made a couple of similar mistakes as last night (in particular with command line Git and GitHub), overall I'm happy to have had a second attempt at the process completed yesterday. Practice makes progress, yes? I felt much more capable tonight, and I moved through the task much quicker as well. Now I just need to get beyond these boilerplate apps, lol, and start providing viewable content to visitors and users!

### Day 3: 27-Feb-25, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Set up my local environment so I can change my workflow to allow building locally, then pushing to server. As opposed to doing evrything live on a production server. 

**Thoughts:** Very happy! A few more things are beginning to look more familiar and click. I'm also very happy with the support I am getting from GenAI! Not neccessarily just cutting and pasting the AI's code, but instead using AI as a private tutor, or personalised StackOverflow, and then trying to using any AI as a template to read, ideally understand, and then customise.

### Day 4: 28-Feb-25, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Set up the core app within Django of the social work private practice app. Again, like yesterday, have moved the build to my local environment. And thanks to DeepSeek and Claude, I have a good plan moving forwward based on their initial ideas and my personalised feedback. 

**Thoughts:** Parts of me keeps thinking I have to learn more and know more before I start trying to 'cheat' with tools like Claude and DeepSeek, but the other part of me is realising this field of study is never-ending. I could study a lifetime, and still not have 'full knowledge'. Further, as more advanced LLMs are released again and again it's beginning to dawn on me that the way to learn and to build has fundamentally changed. I genuinely think I have learned more about implementing Django applications from reading the plans and code of DeepSeek and Claude and asking them questions about it than I had in a good few months of trying to traditionally learning to be a Django developer. So, I am going to test using LLMs to more rapidly build apps and see how far this way of studying and building can take me (with the caveat that I'm still maintaining my traditional student status in my IT masters for the foreseeable future).

### Day 5: 9-Mar-25, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Have new set of requirements for the social work business app. Worked with DeepSeek and Claude to develop new build plan based on these requirements. Actual progress was getting a new venv sorted out after I couldn't work out how to access the old one. 

**Thoughts:** This was very slow progress tonight. Due to a change in circumstances at home I had to step away from this project and coding for over a week, and some of the lessons and muscle memory had been lost since my last attempt. In reality, tonight's effort was more about finding my feet again and preparing for another push (both with this project, and with the #100daysOfCode).

### Day 6: 10-Mar-25, Monday

**Today's Progress:** With new requirements to just make landing page, have created a skeleton landing page and tested locally, and then uploaded this skeleton site to testing server and domain. Made a few obvious styling and content tweaks (via some HTML and CSS changes within a Django App), but now just waiting on style and content requests from business. 

**Thoughts:** Good progress today. Actually coded in 2x 1-hr blocks today instead of one. Lessons were learned about how Django handles front ends, and while DeepSeek and Claude offered great codes templates, I found it was their 'tutoring' content around this snippets and code templates to be the most valuable. I used to think GenAI was often too verbose in answering questions, but when your a student the added context and detail is invaluable.

### Day 7: 12-Mar-25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Began a rebuild of a dormant project, google-calendar-economic-events, as I haven't yet had the requirements finalised for ssws-privatepractice-website. This app yet isn't yet operating on my local server, but there is the bare bones setup that will allow me to work through a debugging process. So the repo isn't yet functional, but I hope to provide useable updates soon.

**Thoughts:** Made huge leaps in progress today due to stumbling upon Cursor AI while sorting on my email inbox. And while I have used both the Claude and DeepSeek platforms for coding help, Cursor is just at a completely different level. To have all the AI assistance embedded in the IDE, that itself is a mimic of VS Code is an absolute game changer. It's very exciting!

### Day 8: 13-Mar-25, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Added a simple front end to the Google Calendar Economic Events app. This allowed me test the functionality. This testing led to app pivoting from Economic data events to an Earnings release events app. From here, I am now working through page by page to test functionality and optimise the UX. PS: Due to this app pivot, I have also renamed the repo (see below).

**Thoughts:** Still very much enjoying using Cursor as an assistance tool, but have done some digging into what is now known as 'vibe coding' and its accompanying pitfalls. While I'm still very much an advocate for using AI tools like this, I do concede that I need to get my software engineering skills and software development process knowledge both up to a high level. That is, any app built that is assisted heavily using AI will become insecure and unscalable unless I have a very structured process and very good understanding of what's going on under the hood. For now, with these practice apps all is okay, but an awareness of the tools and my own limitations is imperative.

### Day 9: 15-Mar-25, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Not sure if this is allowable in the #100daysOfCode rules, but I'm running with it... Today's work is based on UNE's COSC210 Practical Assignment 1. I am currently writing an SQL script that will create a database for a fictional movie store and streaming service. This script will create a PostgreSQL database and set up the given tables with all the required constraints.

**Thoughts:** Working with SQL and PostgreSQL is still more new to me, and when combined with the fact that I'm a bit behind in my coursework, this small assessment has my rather nervous! I think I should be okay, but the sense of unfamiliarity to another reminder how new I am to this, how much there is to learn, and how the cycle will likely never be finished in this new career

### Day 10: 16-Mar-25, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Finished and submitted the assignment for UNE's COSC210 Practical Assignment 1. This involved using an running an SQL script in a Linux environment to create the tables/relations for a movie store & streaming business database. We used PostgreSQL and the table set up required primary, foreign, and composite keys, and involved setting up applicable constraints to maintain data integrity.

**Thoughts:** This assignment was harder than expected, after I had incorrectly assumed a Week 4 1st assignment would be relatively easy. But the actual coding took longer than expected, the constraints required more professional judgement than expected, and working with .sql files and the psql tool was completely new to me. Overall, I'm not sure how I did in the assignment, but I am very happy that I addressed it when I did, and that I now have this experience and exposure under my belt.

### Day 11: 17-Mar-25, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Today I went right back to basics via building a static site in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site, that will be hosted on GitHub Pages is for a side-hustle that I ran while I was an undergraduate student at UTS. Since sales had dropped off significantly since the old site was closed, I thought I'd relaunch the site in the hope it might give my monthly passive income a boost. The site still needs a lot of work, but now at least we have a template to work with.

**Thoughts:** While the site was again assisted by Cursor AI's agentic tools, this time I tried step back and follow a more methodical software development process as opposed to just jumping right into my IDE and smashing in the prompts. I had created another stand-alone file to, firstly, document my Requirements, and then secondly, outline the Design of the website. While the process was rapid, I believe it fundamentally improved the Implementation of the site when creating the structure of the HTML, CSS and JS files & folders.

### Day 12: 18-Mar-25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** This day was much about setting up the hosting on GitHub Pages. It had been a while since I had mucked around with name servers and DNS settings, and thus it took me much longer than expected to get the site up and running. Thankfully, it is now working after some trial and error, and waiting for propogation times.

**Thoughts:** Completing this update a few days late, so (1) I don't really remember my thoughts that much from this time anymore, and (2) I don't think it's best to guess(?) what my thoughts were at the time ex post.

### Day 13: 19-Mar-25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** This day's effort was about styling and making the UI more appealing and less like the boilerplate that Cursor created. I added a couple of images and made changes to the navbar, but the color scheme changes were the main change.

### Day 14: 20-Mar-25, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** With a boilerplate app on GitHub pages, and the styling being polished up, today was about customising the content of the site as well as adding GA4 code to start tracking any visitors. I updated the listed skills and added my qualifications to the site. Next up, I need to sort out better functionality for the Contact section.

### Day 15: 21-Mar-25, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Similar to previous few days efforts, I worked with styling the app. I learned how and where CSS is accessed and changed in a Django project, and I updated the colour scheme, made a few content changes to improve the UI, and did a fair bit of work in PhotoShop and Canva to try and sort out an image I wanted to use.

**Thoughts:** Feel good today, and actually considering I may be more of a front end person that I originally imagined. While starting to learn Python and PostgreSQL had made me think that I was aiming at the back end, I do seem to get a sense of joy about updating the UI with just simple design changes.
